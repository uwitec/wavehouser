A 'spin button control' (also known as an up-down control) is a pair of arrow buttons that the user can click to increment or decrement a value, such as a scroll position or a number displayed in a companion control. The value associated with a spin button control is called its current position. A spin button control is most often used with a companion control, called a 'buddy window.'
