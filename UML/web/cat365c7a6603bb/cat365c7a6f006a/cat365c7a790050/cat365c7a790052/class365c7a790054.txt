CHtmlStream is a class that manages in-memory HTML. HTML memory files are useful for temporarily storing raw bytes or serialized objects prior to their transmission. Although it is not derived from CFile, CHtmlStream behaves like the CFile-derived class CMemFile, except CHtmlStream is used to store data in a temporary buffer prior to sending it out, and the data stored in a CHtmlStream memory file cannot be read.
