CPrintInfo stores information about a print or print-preview job. The framework creates an object of CPrintInfo each time the Print or Print Preview command is chosen and destroys it when the command is completed. 

CPrintInfo contains information about both the print job as a whole, such as the range of pages to be printed, and the current status of the print job, such as the page currently being printed. Some information is stored in an associated CPrintDialog object; this object contains the values entered by the user in the Print dialog box.
