The class CHttpServer, with CHttpServerContext, provides a means to extend the functionality of an ISAPI-compliant HTTP server. The class CHttpServer wraps the Internet Server API (ISAPI) functionality and can process all types of client requests, including both Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executables and extension DLLs. These extension DLLs are sometimes called Internet Server Applications; however, they are DLLs, rather than EXEs.
