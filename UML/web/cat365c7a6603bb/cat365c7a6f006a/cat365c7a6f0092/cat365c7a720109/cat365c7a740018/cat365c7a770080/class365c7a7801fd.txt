A 'tab control' is analogous to the dividers in a notebook or the labels in a file cabinet. By using a tab control, an application can define multiple pages for the same area of a window or dialog box. Each page consists of a set of information or a group of controls that the application displays when the user selects the corresponding tab. A special type of tab control displays tabs that look like buttons. Clicking a button should immediately perform a command instead of displaying a page.
