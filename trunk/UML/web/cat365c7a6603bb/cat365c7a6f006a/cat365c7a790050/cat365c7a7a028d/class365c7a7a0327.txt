The CDaoFieldExchange class supports the DAO record field exchange (DFX) routines used by the DAO database classes. Use this class if you are writing data exchange routines for custom data types; otherwise, you will not directly use this class. DFX exchanges data between the field data members of your CDaoRecordset object and the corresponding fields of the current record on the data source. DFX manages the exchange in both directions, from the data source and to the data source.
