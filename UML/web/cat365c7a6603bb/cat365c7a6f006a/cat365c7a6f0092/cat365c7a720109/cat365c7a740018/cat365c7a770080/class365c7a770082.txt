The CAnimateCtrl class provides the functionality of the Windows common animation control. This control (and therefore the CAnimateCtrl class) is available only to programs running under Windows 95 and Windows NT version 3.51 and later.

An animation control is a rectangular window that displays a clip in AVI (Audio Video Interleaved) format - the standard Windows video/audio format. An AVI clip is a series of bitmap frames, like a movie.
