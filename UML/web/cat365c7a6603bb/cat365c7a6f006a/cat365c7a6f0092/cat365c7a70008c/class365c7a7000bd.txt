A CRecordset object represents a set of records selected from a data source. Known as 'recordsets,' CRecordset objects are typically used in two forms: dynasets and snapshots. A dynaset stays synchronized with data updates made by other users. A snapshot is a static view of the data. Each form represents a set of records fixed at the time the recordset is opened, but when you scroll to a record in a dynaset, it reflects changes subsequently made to the record, either by other users or by other recordsets in your application.
