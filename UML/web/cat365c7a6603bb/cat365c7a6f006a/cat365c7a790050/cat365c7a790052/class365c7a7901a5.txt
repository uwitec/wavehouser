CHttpServerContext provides the tools that a CHttpServer object needs to process data that a client has sent to the HTTP server. When a Microsoft Internet Information Server (MIIS) receives a request from a client browser, a CHttpServer object is created and initialized, and a CHttpServerContext object is created. As the server extension DLL processes requests, it uses CHttpServerContext member functions to perform tasks.
