A CReBar object is a control bar that provides layout, persistence, and state information for rebar controls.

A rebar object can contain a variety of child windows, usually other controls, including edit boxes, toolbars, and list boxes. A rebar object can display its child windows over a specified bitmap. Your application can automatically resize the rebar, or the user can manually resize the rebar by clicking or dragging its gripper bar.
