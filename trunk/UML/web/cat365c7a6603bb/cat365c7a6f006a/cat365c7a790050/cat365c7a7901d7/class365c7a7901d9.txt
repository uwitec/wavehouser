A COleCurrency object encapsulates the CURRENCY data type of OLE automation. CURRENCY is implemented as an 8-byte, two's-complement integer value scaled by 10,000. This gives a fixed-point number with 15 digits to the left of the decimal point and 4 digits to the right. The CURRENCY data type is extremely useful for calculations involving money, or for any fixed-point calculation where accuracy is important. It is one of the possible types for the VARIANT data type of OLE automation.
