The MFC class CInternetFile provides a base class for the CHttpFile and CGopherFile file classes. CInternetFile and its derived classes allow access to files on remote systems that use Internet protocols. You never create a CInternetFile object directly. Instead, create an object of one of its derived classes by calling CGopherConnection::OpenFile or CHttpConnection::OpenRequest. You also can create a CInternetFile object by calling CFtpConnection::OpenFile.
