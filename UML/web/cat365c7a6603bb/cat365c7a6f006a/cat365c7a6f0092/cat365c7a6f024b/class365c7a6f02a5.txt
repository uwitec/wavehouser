CMapStringToOb is a dictionary collection class that maps unique CString objects to CObject pointers. Once you have inserted a CString-CObject* pair (element) into the map, you can efficiently retrieve or delete the pair using a string or a CString value as a key. You can also iterate over all the elements in the map.
