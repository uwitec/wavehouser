The COleTemplateServer class is used for OLE visual editing servers, automation servers, and link containers (applications that support links to embeddings). 

Use COleTemplateServer when implementing a full server, that is, a server that can be run as a standalone application. One COleTemplateServer object is needed for each type of server document an application supports; that is, if your server application supports both worksheets and charts, you must have two COleTemplateServer objects.
