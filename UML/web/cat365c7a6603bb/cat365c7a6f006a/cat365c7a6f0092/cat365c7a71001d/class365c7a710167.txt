CAsyncMonikerFile provides functionality for the use of asynchronous monikers in ActiveX controls (formerly OLE controls). Derived from CMonikerFile, which in turn is derived from COleStreamFile, CAsyncMonikerFile uses the IMoniker interface to access any data stream asynchronously, including loading files asynchronously from a URL. The files can be datapath properties of ActiveX controls.
