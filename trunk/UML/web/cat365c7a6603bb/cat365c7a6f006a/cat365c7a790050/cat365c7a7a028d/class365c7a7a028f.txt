The CCmdUI class is used only within an ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler in a CCmdTarget-derived class.

When a user of your application pulls down a menu, each menu item needs to know whether it should be displayed as enabled or disabled. The target of a menu command provides this information by implementing an ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler. 

When the menu is pulled down, the framework searches for and calls each ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler, each handler calls CCmdUI member functions such as Enable and Check, and the framework then appropriately displays each menu item.
