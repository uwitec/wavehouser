CDockState is a serialized CObject class that loads, unloads, or clears the state of one or more docking control bars in persistent memory (a file). The dock state includes the size and position of the bar and whether or not it is docked. When retrieving the stored dock state, CDockState checks the bar's position and, if the bar is not visible with the current screen settings, CDockState scales the bar's position so that it is visible. The main purpose of CDockState is to hold the entire state of a number of control bars and to allow that state to be saved and loaded either to the registry, the application's .INI file, or in binary form as part of a CArchive object's contents.
