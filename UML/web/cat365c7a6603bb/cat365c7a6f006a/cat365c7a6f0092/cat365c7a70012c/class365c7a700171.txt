The CObArray class supports arrays of CObject pointers. These object arrays are similar to C arrays, but they can dynamically shrink and grow as necessary. 

Array indexes always start at position 0. You can decide whether to fix the upper bound or allow the array to expand when you add elements past the current bound. Memory is allocated contiguously to the upper bound, even if some elements are null.
