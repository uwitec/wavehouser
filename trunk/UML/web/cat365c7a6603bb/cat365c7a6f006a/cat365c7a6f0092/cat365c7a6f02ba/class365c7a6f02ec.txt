An object of class CEvent represents an 'event' (a synchronization object that allows one thread to notify another that an event has occurred). Events are useful when a thread needs to know when to perform its task. For example, a thread that copies data to a data archive would need to be notified when new data is available. By using a CEvent object to notify the copy thread when new data is available, the thread can perform its task as soon as possible.
