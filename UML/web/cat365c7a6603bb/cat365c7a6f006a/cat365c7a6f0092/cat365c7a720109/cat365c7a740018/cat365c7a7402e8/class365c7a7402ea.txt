CControlBar is the base class for the control-bar classes CStatusBar, CToolBar, CDialogBar, and COleResizeBar. A control bar is a window that is usually aligned to the left or right of a frame window. It may contain child items that are either HWND-based controls, which are Windows windows that generate and respond to Windows messages, or non-HWND-based items, which are not windows and are managed by application code or framework code.
