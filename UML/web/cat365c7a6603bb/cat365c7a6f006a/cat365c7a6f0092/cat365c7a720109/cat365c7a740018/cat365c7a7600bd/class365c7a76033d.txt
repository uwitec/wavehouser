A CDaoRecordView object is a view that displays database records in controls. The view is a form view directly connected to a CDaoRecordset object. The view is created from a dialog template resource and displays the fields of the CDaoRecordset object in the dialog template's controls. The CDaoRecordView object uses dialog data exchange (DDX) and DAO record field exchange (DFX) to automate the movement of data between the controls on the form and the fields of the recordset. CDaoRecordView also supplies a default implementation for moving to the first, next, previous, or last record and an interface for updating the record currently in view.
