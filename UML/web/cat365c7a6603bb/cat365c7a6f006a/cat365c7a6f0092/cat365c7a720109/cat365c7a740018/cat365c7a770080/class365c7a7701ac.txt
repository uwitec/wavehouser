A 'hot key control' is a window that enables the user to create a hot key. A 'hot key' is a key combination that the user can press to perform an action quickly. (For example, a user can create a hot key that activates a given window and brings it to the top of the Z order.) The hot key control displays the user's choices and ensures that the user selects a valid key combination.
