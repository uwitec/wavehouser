The COleControlModule class is the base class from which you derive an OLE control module object. This class provides member functions for initializing your control module. Each OLE control module that uses the Microsoft Foundation classes can only contain one object derived from COleControlModule. This object is constructed when other C++ global objects are constructed. Declare your derived COleControlModule object at the global level.
