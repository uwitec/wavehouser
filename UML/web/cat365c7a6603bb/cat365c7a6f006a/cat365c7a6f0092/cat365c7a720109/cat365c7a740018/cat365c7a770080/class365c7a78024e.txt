The CToolBarCtrl class provides the functionality of the Windows toolbar common control. This control (and therefore the CToolBarCtrl class) is available only to programs running under Windows 95 and Windows NT version 3.51 and later.

A Windows toolbar common control is a rectangular child window that contains one or more buttons. These buttons can display a bitmap image, a string, or both. When the user chooses a button, it sends a command message to the toolbar's owner window.
