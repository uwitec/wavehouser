The class CGopherLocator gets a gopher 'locator' from a gopher server, determines the locator's type, and makes the locator available to CGopherFileFind. 

An application must get a gopher server's locator before it can retrieve information from that server. Once it has the locator, it must treat the locator as an opaque token.

Each gopher locator has attributes that determine the type of file or server found.
