A 'slider control' (also known as a trackbar) is a window containing a slider and optional tick marks. When the user moves the slider, using either the mouse or the direction keys, the control sends notification messages to indicate the change.

Slider controls are useful when you want the user to select a discrete value or a set of consecutive values in a range.
