The CFieldExchange class supports the record field exchange (RFX) and bulk record field exchange (Bulk RFX) routines used by the database classes. Use this class if you are writing data exchange routines for custom data types or when you are implementing bulk row fetching; otherwise, you will not directly use this class. RFX and Bulk RFX exchanges data between the field data members of your recordset object and the corresponding fields of the current record on the data source.
