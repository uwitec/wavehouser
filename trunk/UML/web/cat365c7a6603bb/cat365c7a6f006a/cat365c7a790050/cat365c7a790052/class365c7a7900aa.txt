CHttpFilter creates and manages, with CHttpFilterContext, a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) filter object. An HTTP filter is a replaceable dynamic link library (DLL) that the server calls on every HTTP request. When the filter is loaded, it tells the server what sort of notifications it is interested in. After that, whenever the selected events occur, the filter is called and given the opportunity to process that event.
