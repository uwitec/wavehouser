The CPalette class encapsulates a Windows color palette. A palette provides an interface between an application and a color output device (such as a display device). The interface allows the application to take full advantage of the color capabilities of the output device without severely interfering with the colors displayed by other applications. Windows uses the application's logical palette (a list of needed colors) and the system palette (which defines available colors) to determine the colors used.
