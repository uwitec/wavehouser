The CStatic class provides the functionality of a Windows static control. A static control displays a text string, box, rectangle, icon, cursor, bitmap, or enhanced metafile. It can be used to label, box, or separate other controls. A static control normally takes no input and provides no output; however, it can notify its parent of mouse clicks if it's created with SS_NOTIFY style.
