A CAsyncSocket object represents a Windows Socket, an endpoint of network communication. Class CAsyncSocket encapsulates the Windows Sockets API, providing an object-oriented abstraction for programmers who want to use Windows Sockets in conjunction with MFC.

This class is based on the assumption that you understand network communications. You are responsible for handling blocking, byte-order differences, and conversions between Unicode and multibyte character set (MBCS) strings.
