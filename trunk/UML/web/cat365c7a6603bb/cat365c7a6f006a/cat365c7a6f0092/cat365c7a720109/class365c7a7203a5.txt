The COleMessageFilter class manages the concurrency required by the interaction of OLE applications. 

The COleMessageFilter class is useful in visual editing server and container applications, as well as OLE automation applications. For server applications that are being called, this class can be used to make the application 'busy' so that incoming calls from other container applications are either canceled or retried later. This class can also be used to determine the action to be taken by a calling application when the called application is busy.
