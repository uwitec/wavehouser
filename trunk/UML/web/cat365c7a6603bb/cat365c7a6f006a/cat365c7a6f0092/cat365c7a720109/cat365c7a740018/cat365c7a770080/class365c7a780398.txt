A CDateTimeCtrl object encapsulates the functionality of a date and time picker control. The date and time picker control (DTP control) provides a simple interface to exchange date and time information with a user. This interface contains fields, each of which displays a part of the date and time information stored in the control. The user can change the information stored in the control by changing the content of the string in a given field. The user can move from field to field using the mouse or the keyboard.
