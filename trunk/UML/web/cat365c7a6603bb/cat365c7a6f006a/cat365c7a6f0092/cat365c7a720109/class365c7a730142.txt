COleServerDoc is the base class for OLE server documents. A server document can contain COleServerItem objects, which represent the server interface to embedded or linked items. When a server application is launched by a container to edit an embedded item, the item is loaded as its own server document; the COleServerDoc object contains just one COleServerItem object, consisting of the entire document. When a server application is launched by a container to edit a linked item, an existing document is loaded from disk; a portion of the document's contents is highlighted to indicate the linked item.
