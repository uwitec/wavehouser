An object of class CSingleLock represents the access-control mechanism used in controlling access to a resource in a multithreaded program. In order to use the synchronization classes CSemaphore, CMutex, CCriticalSection, and CEvent, you must create either a CSingleLock or CMultiLock object to wait on and release the synchronization object. Use CSingleLock when you only need to wait on one object at a time. Use CMultiLock when there are multiple objects that you could use at a particular time.
