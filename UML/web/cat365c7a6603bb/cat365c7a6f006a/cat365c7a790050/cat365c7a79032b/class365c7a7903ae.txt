Each class derived from CObject is associated with a CRuntimeClass structure that you can use to obtain information about an object or its base class at run time. The ability to determine the class of an object at run time is useful when extra type checking of function arguments is needed, or when you must write special-purpose code based on the class of an object. Run-time class information is not supported directly by the C++ language.
