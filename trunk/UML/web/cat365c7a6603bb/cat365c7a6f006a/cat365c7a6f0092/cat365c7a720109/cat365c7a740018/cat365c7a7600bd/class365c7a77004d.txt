A COleDBRecordView object is a view that displays database records in controls. The view is a form view directly connected to a CRowset object. The view is created from a dialog template resource and displays the fields of the CRowset object in the dialog template's controls. The COleDBRecordView object uses dialog data exchange (DDX), and the navigational functionality built into CRowSet, to automate the movement of data between the controls on the form and the fields of the rowset. COleDBRecordView also supplies a default implementation for moving to the first, next, previous, or last record and an interface for updating the record currently on view.
