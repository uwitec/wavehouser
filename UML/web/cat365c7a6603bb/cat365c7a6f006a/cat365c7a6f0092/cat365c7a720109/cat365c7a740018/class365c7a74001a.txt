The CWnd class provides the base functionality of all window classes in the Microsoft Foundation Class Library. 

A CWnd object is distinct from a Windows window, but the two are tightly linked. 

The CWnd class and the message-map mechanism hide the WndProc function.

The CWnd class also lets you create a Windows child window for your application.
