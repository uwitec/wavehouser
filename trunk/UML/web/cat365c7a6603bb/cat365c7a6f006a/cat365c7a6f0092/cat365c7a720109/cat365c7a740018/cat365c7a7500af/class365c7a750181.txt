The CFindReplaceDialog class allows you to implement standard string Find/Replace dialog boxes in your application. Unlike the other Windows common dialog boxes, CFindReplaceDialog objects are modeless, allowing users to interact with other windows while they are on screen. There are two kinds of CFindReplaceDialog objects: Find dialog boxes and Find/Replace dialog boxes. Although the dialog boxes allow the user to input search and search/replace strings, they do not perform any of the searching or replacing functions. You must add these to the application.
