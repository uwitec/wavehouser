An object of class CCriticalSection represents a 'critical section' (a synchronization object that allows one thread at a time to access a resource or section of code). Critical sections are useful when only one thread at a time can be allowed to modify data or some other controlled resource. For example, adding nodes to a linked list is a process that should only be allowed by one thread at a time. By using a CCriticalSection object to control the linked list, only one thread at a time can gain access to the list.
