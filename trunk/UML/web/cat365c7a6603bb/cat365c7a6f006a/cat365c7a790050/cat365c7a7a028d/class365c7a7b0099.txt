The COleDataObject class is used in data transfers for retrieving data in various formats from the Clipboard, through drag and drop, or from an embedded OLE item. 

This class enables you to determine whether the data exists in a specified format. You can also enumerate the available data formats or check whether a given format is available and then retrieve the data in the preferred format. Object retrieval can be accomplished in several different ways, including the use of a CFile, an HGLOBAL, or an STGMEDIUM structure.
